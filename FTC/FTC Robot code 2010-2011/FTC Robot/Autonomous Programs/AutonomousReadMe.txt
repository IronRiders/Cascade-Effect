Version 1 (2/18/2011)

-We have created this directory structure and we can edit this read me file whenever we update something. This is "like" a software engineering text file. Before we code anything, it is advised that we read this file first, as it may contain important information and warnings.
-Two autonomouses files have been created: 
	|2-18-2011/Balance/LeftBridgeBalance.c has nothing in it and is yet to be coded.
	|2-18-2011/Balance/RightBridgeBalance.c has nothing in it and is yet to be coded.
	|2-18-2011/main.c has all the "cases" and "switches" in it to choose the right program to run when the user inputs the data. So far, we only created the case/switch for the "Balancing" option.

Version 2 (2/23/2011)

-We created the autonomous for dispensing the preloaded batons
	-It starts from the red left side and takes the preloaded batons to dispense them in the goal.

-We created the autonomous for dispensing the preloaded batons and then going to the other side of the field.
	-This one does the same thing but it also parks itself on the other side of the field using the mountain.
-The autonomous chooser has been updated to include these two files.
